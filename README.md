# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
 Hotel Booking cancellation analysis using Excel.


<b>Objective:</b><br>
The Booking Cancellation analysis is performed to identify the reasons for the cancellations and to overcome those problems.
<br><br>

<b>Data Descriptions:</b><br>
The data provided here consists of Hotel type - Resort Hotel or City Hotel, Is Cancelled - cancelled or not, Arrival year and month, Number of Adults, Children and Babies,
The countries, the desired and assigned room type, Amount, reservation status and reservation date , and other details of the Guest.
<br><br>

<b>Problems I encountered:</b><br>
There are 37% of cancellations combining both the hotels.

1) The cancellation rate of Resort hotel is more than the city hotel.
2) People are not getting the room that they Desired.
3) The repeating guest list does not change. Which means the people are not satisfied by the service.
4) Most of the reservations are done in the month of July and August, and most of the cancellations are also done in the same month.
   In these 2 months the Amount is also much higher.
